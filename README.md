# MKS22X-BallRock
Day 1:
Amit - Ball display; Mario - Ball movement
Coby - Rock display; Greg - Rock movement

Day 2:
Amit and Alvi(Mario replaced) work on ball changes
Coby and Greg work on rock changes
Coby/Greg: Messed with old rock display a bit before moving on to image based. Completed 2 display modes, randomly selected on construction  
Alvi: Programmed collide-able interface  
Amit: Created two  ball subclasses (GravityBall/PongBall) & changed setup method. Balls turn red when touching rocks  

Day 3:
Greg added linear (straight) and quadratic interpolated (smooth) movement to the living rock
Coby changed rock sizes and fixed syntax (int==1 changed into boolean). Also added eyes to Dwayne, and eyes in a different place to Stone.
Mario: Fixed Collisions, and started to differentiate PongBall from GravityBall
Amit: Added more interesting Coloring to GravityBall, helped fix collisions
Alvi: Started making PongBall have a "bounce" animation
